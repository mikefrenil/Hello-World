Affine Gap Penalty
------------------

The problem of sequence alignment with general gap penalty (gap problem) is a generalization of
the edit distance problem that arises in molecular biology, geology, and speech recognition. When
transforming a string X = x1x2 . . . xm into another string Y = y1y2 . . . yn, a sequence of consecutive
deletes corresponds to a gap in X, and a sequence of consecutive inserts corresponds to a gap in
Y . An affine gap penalty function is predominantly used in bioinformatics.
